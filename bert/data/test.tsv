no	The file where this database was last saved to
no	Returns the first existing file directory from link getFileDirectories FilePreferences

no	From the Bibtex manual Pops the top two string literals it changes the case of the second according to the specifications of the first as follows Note The word letters in the next sentence refers only to those at brace level 0 the top most brace level no other characters are changed except perhaps for special characters described in Section 4 If the first literal is the string t it converts to lower case all letters except the very first character in the string which it leaves alone and except the first character following any colon and then nonnull white space which it also leaves alone if it s the string l it converts all letters to lower case and if it s the string u it converts all letters to upper case It then pushes this resulting string If either type is incorrect it complains and pushes the null string however if both types are correct but the specification string i e the first string isn t one of the legal ones it merely pushes the second back onto the stack after complaining Another note It ignores case differences in the specification string for example the strings t and T are equivalent for the purposes of this built in function Christopher I think this should be another grammar This parser is horrible
