tests if we are running an acceptable java and terminates jabref when we are sure the version is not supported this test uses the requirements for the java version as specified in code gradle build code it is possible to define a minimum version including the built number and to indicate whether java 9 can be used which it currently can t it tries to compare this version number to the version of the currently running jvm the check is optimistic and will rather return true even if we could not exactly determine the version p note users with a very old version like 1 6 will not profit from this since class versions are incompatible and jabref won t even start currently jabref won t start with java 9 either but the warning that it cannot be used with this version is helpful anyway to prevent users to update from an old 1 8 directly to version 9 additionally we soon might have a jabref that does start with java 9 but is not perfectly compatible therefore we should leave the java 9 check alive

leftover arguments that have a bib extension are interpreted as bib files to open other files and files that could not be opened as bib we try to import instead
