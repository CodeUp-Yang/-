this event is fired from link org jabref logic autosaveandbackup autosavemanager in case that a save task is pending
this is kept in sync with the database upon adding removing an entry it is updated as well
writes all data to the specified writer using each object s tostring method
returns whether an entry with the given id exists entry type hashcode
returns a set of strings that contains all field names that are visible this means that the fields are not internal fields internal fields are fields that are starting with
collects entries having the specified bibtex key and returns these entries as list the order of the entries is the order they appear in the database
inserts the entry given that its id is not already in use use util createid to make up a unique id for an entry
removes the given entry the entry is removed based on the id link bibentry id
take the given bibentry and resolve any string references
if we get to this point the string has obviously not been defined locally check if one of the standard bibtex month strings has been used
we did not find the boundaries of the string ref this makes it impossible to interpret it as a string label so we should just append the rest of the text and finish
the file where this database was last saved to
returns the first existing file directory from link getfiledirectories filepreferences
take care using crossrefentry comparator that referred entries occur after referring ones this is a necessary requirement for bibtex to be able to resolve referenced entries correctly
if dir is only current directory just use its parent real current directory as path
this node s parent or null if this node has no parent
returns this node s parent or an empty optional if this node has no parent
returns true if this node is an ancestor of the given node p a node is considered an ancestor of itself
adds the given node at the end of the chain e g a b c d a b c d
we use some explicit casts of the form t this the constructor ensures that this cast is valid
filters change events and only relays major changes
search all fields search within the acm guide to computing literature encompasses the acm full text collection bibtex format
map to collect entry type definitions that we must save along with entries using them
this exception is thrown in case that the sql database structure is not compatible with the current shared database support mechanisms
some file formats write something at the start of the file like the encoding
use a map instead of a set since i need to know how many of each key is in there
helper function for counting the number of the key usages removes the given key from the internal keyset together with the count of it if the key is set to 1 if it is not set to 1 the counter will be decreased br special case if a null or empty key is passed it is not counted and thus not removed
runs the formatter on the specified field in the given entry if the formatter returns an empty string then the field is removed
array of children may be empty if this node has no children but never null
get the child index of this node in its parent p if this node is a root then an unsupportedoperationexception is thrown use the isroot method to check for this case
gets the number of levels above this node i e the distance from the root to this node p if this node is the root returns 0
returns the path from the root to get to this node the last element in the path is this node
returns the previous sibling of this node in the parent s children list returns an empty optional if this node has no parent or is the parent s first child p this method performs a linear search that is o n where n is the number of children
check if we must write the type definition for this entry as well our criterion is that all non standard types not all customized standard types must be written
removes the subtree rooted at this node from the tree giving this node an empty parent does nothing if this node is the root of it tree
if user defined entry type then add it otherwise enrich returns empty optional it is a completely unknown entry type so ignore it
sorts the list of children according to the order induced by the specified link comparator p all children must be mutually comparable using the specified comparator that is code c compare e1 e2 must not throw a code classcastexception for any children code e1 and code e2 in the list
removes this node from its parent and makes it a child of the specified node by adding it to the specified position in the children list in this way the whole subtree based at this node is moved to the given node
creates a deep copy of this node and all of its children
perform checks and changes for users with a preference set from an older jabref version
added from jabref 2 11 beta 4 onwards to fix wrong encoding names
upgrade the sort order preferences for the current version the old preference is kept in case an old version of jabref is used with these preferences but it is only used when the new preference does not exist
migrate default pattern
pref node already exists do not migrate from previous version
finally write whatever remains of the file but at least a concluding newline
formats a field value by with a particular formatter transformation calling this method with a null argument results in a nullpointerexception
fulltextfetcher implementation that attempts to find a pdf url at acs
add the formatter to the map if it is not already there
convert the contents of the hashmap into the correct serialization
then we go through the string looking for references to other strings if we find references to strings that we will write but still haven t we write those before proceeding this ensures that the string order will be acceptable for bibtex
imports a biblioscape tag file the format is described on http www biblioscape com download biblioscape8 pdf several biblioscape field types are ignored others are only included in the bibtex field comment

return a bibentry by looking up the given url from the bibsonomy scraper
first try to match by string names
but they have non matching contents so we ve found a change
see if we can detect a name change for those entries that we couldn t match based on their content
finally see if there are remaining strings in the new database they must have been added
we re dealing with a special character usually either an undotted i or j or an accent like one in table 3 1 of the latex manual or a foreign character like one in table 3 2 if the first character after the left brace is a backslash the special character ends with the matching right brace how we handle what is in between depends on the special character in general this code will do reasonably well if there is other stuff too between braces but it doesn t try to do anything special with colon s
retrieve pdf link
determine whether there starts a special char at pos e g oe ae return it as string if nothing found return optional empty also used by bibtexpurify
three options 1 original order 2 order specified in metadata 3 order specified in preferences
skip over open brace

from the bibtex manual pops the top two string literals it changes the case of the second according to the specifications of the first as follows note the word letters in the next sentence refers only to those at brace level 0 the top most brace level no other characters are changed except perhaps for special characters described in section 4 if the first literal is the string t it converts to lower case all letters except the very first character in the string which it leaves alone and except the first character following any colon and then nonnull white space which it also leaves alone if it s the string l it converts all letters to lower case and if it s the string u it converts all letters to upper case it then pushes this resulting string if either type is incorrect it complains and pushes the null string however if both types are correct but the specification string i e the first string isn t one of the legal ones it merely pushes the second back onto the stack after complaining another note it ignores case differences in the specification string for example the strings t and t are equivalent for the purposes of this built in function christopher i think this should be another grammar this parser is horrible
doi field seems to contain doi cleanup note url ee field
we have begun to use getsortedentries for both database save operations and non database save operations in a non database save operation such as the exportdatabase call we do not wish to use the global preference of saving in standard order
