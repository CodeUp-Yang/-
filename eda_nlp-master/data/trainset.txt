no	tests if we are running an acceptable java and terminates jabref when we are sure the version is not supported this test uses the requirements for the java version as specified in code gradle build code it is possible to define a minimum version including the built number and to indicate whether java 9 can be used which it currently can t it tries to compare this version number to the version of the currently running jvm the check is optimistic and will rather return true even if we could not exactly determine the version p note users with a very old version like 1 6 will not profit from this since class versions are incompatible and jabref won t even start currently jabref won t start with java 9 either but the warning that it cannot be used with this version is helpful anyway to prevent users to update from an old 1 8 directly to version 9 additionally we soon might have a jabref that does start with java 9 but is not perfectly compatible therefore we should leave the java 9 check alive

no	helper function for counting the number of the key usages removes the given key from the internal keyset together with the count of it if the key is set to 1 if it is not set to 1 the counter will be decreased br special case if a null or empty key is passed it is not counted and thus not removed

yes	returns whether the specified index is a valid index for a child
no	check if we must write the type definition for this entry as well our criterion is that all non standard types not all customized standard types must be written
no	removes the subtree rooted at this node from the tree giving this node an empty parent does nothing if this node is the root of it tree
no	if user defined entry type then add it otherwise enrich returns empty optional it is a completely unknown entry type so ignore it

yes	nothing to sort
no	perform checks and changes for users with a preference set from an older jabref version

no	see if we can detect a name change for those entries that we couldn t match based on their content
no	finally see if there are remaining strings in the new database they must have been added
no	we re dealing with a special character usually either an undotted i or j or an accent like one in table 3 1 of the latex manual or a foreign character like one in table 3 2 if the first character after the left brace is a backslash the special character ends with the matching right brace how we handle what is in between depends on the special character in general this code will do reasonably well if there is other stuff too between braces but it doesn t try to do anything special with colon s

no	from the bibtex manual pops the top two string literals it changes the case of the second according to the specifications of the first as follows note the word letters in the next sentence refers only to those at brace level 0 the top most brace level no other characters are changed except perhaps for special characters described in section 4 if the first literal is the string t it converts to lower case all letters except the very first character in the string which it leaves alone and except the first character following any colon and then nonnull white space which it also leaves alone if it s the string l it converts all letters to lower case and if it s the string u it converts all letters to upper case it then pushes this resulting string if either type is incorrect it complains and pushes the null string however if both types are correct but the specification string i e the first string isn t one of the legal ones it merely pushes the second back onto the stack after complaining another note it ignores case differences in the specification string for example the strings t and t are equivalent for the purposes of this built in function christopher i think this should be another grammar this parser is horrible
no	doi field seems to contain doi cleanup note url ee field
no	we have begun to use getsortedentries for both database save operations and non database save operations in a non database save operation such as the exportdatabase call we do not wish to use the global preference of saving in standard order
